# Sloplets: Your AI Deserves Its Own Disaster Zone

## The Problem: Code Execution on Your Actual Machine

Imagine a scenario where you instruct your AI assistant to summarize your emails and then make a commit to your GitHub repository. The assistant has real access to your Gmail account via `gog gmail search` and real access to your repository via `git push`. Everything seems straightforward until the model makes a critical error—perhaps it misinterprets a command and attempts to run `rm -rf /`. Without proper isolation, this single hallucination would result in catastrophic data loss on your actual machine.

Now consider the same workflow where each tool invocation executes inside a disposable Docker container. The AI attempts the same destructive command, but the container is destroyed immediately afterward. The email summary reaches your terminal safely. The commit is made successfully. Nothing is broken. This is a sloplet doing its job correctly.

## Understanding Sandboxes

A sandbox is an isolated, temporary computing environment where an AI agent can safely execute code, run system commands, install packages, and interact with real tools without risking the stability of your primary system. When a large language model needs to perform actions beyond conversation—to write code, execute scripts, or access external systems—it requires a safe execution environment. A sandbox provides exactly that: a controlled space where potentially harmful operations are contained and ephemeral.

## The Sandbox Product Landscape

Several companies have built dedicated sandbox solutions tailored for AI agents. Each approaches the problem differently, with varying trade-offs between control, cost, and ease of use.

### Product Comparison

| Product | Core Offering | Typical Cost | Key Strength |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **exe.dev** | Persistent virtual machines accessible via SSH | ~$10–40/month | Persistent disk state; full `sudo` access; long-running agent environments |
| **sprites.dev** (Fly.io) | Hardware-isolated ephemeral VMs with sub-second startup | Per-second CPU/memory billing | Instant VM provisioning; checkpointable state; ideal for high-throughput agent tasks |
| **E2B** | Purpose-built AI sandbox platform with multiple language SDKs | Pay-per-use or enterprise plans | Extensively battle-tested (200M+ sandboxes launched); optimized for coding agents; Fortune 100 adoption |
| **Modal** | High-performance serverless inference and job execution | Per-second compute or fixed pricing tiers | Sub-second cold starts; elastic GPU scaling; built for training and large-scale inference workloads |
| **DIY DigitalOcean + Docker** | Self-managed Droplet with Docker containerization | ~$6–15/month base VM | Complete control; lowest cost at low volume; excellent educational value; full customization |

### Permanent VMs: exe.dev

exe.dev offers bare-minimum, no-frills persistent virtual machines that you access via SSH. The disk state persists between sessions, and you have full sudo privileges. This approach is ideal for agentic workflows that require a continuous working environment where your AI can maintain state, configuration, and contextual information across multiple tasks.

The value proposition is straightforward: your AI gets a home. It is not born anew with every request; instead, it inhabits a persistent space where it can accumulate knowledge and build on previous work.

### Instant VMs: sprites.dev

sprites.dev, created by Fly.io, delivers hardware-isolated sandboxes that are ready for execution in under one second. Each Sprite is a self-contained virtual machine that can be checkpointed—frozen and restored—like a process. Billing is proportional to actual CPU and memory consumpti
