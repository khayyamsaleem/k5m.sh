nuking and paving my blog to reflect my actual level of laziness + all the new tools that have come out. most of my workflows are no longer hierarchical in nature; they're more like "bag of text" + "loose files in dir" + "tags or semantic search for retrieval" vibes. going to try to build a blog that supports that!

i'll build in obsidian, and publish with hugo, and add in some local sauce to ensure that images get pushed to a cdn rather than sitting in the repo.

here's a start:

## goals
just gonna write about travel + tech + loose thoughts, and lower the bar for what i publish. want the firehose in my head to be rendered online, and hopefully make it easy to query. 

next steps are to:
- [ ] write more
- [ ] figure out how to add a semantic search
- [ ] figure out how to get the editing experience golden
	- [ ] image auto-upload
	- [ ] obsidian save => hugo republish
	- [ ] filtering by tags
	- [ ] render obsidian data-views
